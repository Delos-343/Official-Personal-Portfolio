                    <p class="mb-5">A quote from one of the more lesser-known yet major players in the world of leadership and global influence.</p>
                    <h3>1.1. &nbsp; Cliché without context, the quote provides clarity to the state of being a leader :</h3>
                    <p class="mb-5">By understanding that even the most mundane of tasks could play a critical, long-term role in ensuring one's continued success.</p>
                    <h3>1.2. &nbsp; When you take a thought provoking quote and emplace it upon your own reality :</h3>
                    <p class="mb-5">It becomes reality in itself. By base logic, it is indeed formulated by a real person behind the scenes. By literature, a quote is an allegory for reality; a state of representation that allows for a more free and creative yet simplified grasp at one's perception or vision of it. Effectively, both served to pass on a message.</p>

                    <p>A quote that I've been saying to myself since I first watched a random GaryVee speech reel. And it's been stuck in my mind ever since; in fact, it had become a permanent principle from which I abide by in life.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">And it is true; it feels legit; to abide by this principle. It is the one thing that most people today need to learn to understand and accept. Let me hit you up with some more GaryVee quotes related to mine's :</p>
                    <ul class="list-unstyled li-space-lg mb-4">
                        <li class="media">
                            <i class="fas fa-square"></i>
                            <div class="media-body"><strong>I talk about shit I’ve lived.</strong> I say things I mean. I think a lot of people try to build motivation accounts and tweak things or put things on Instagram that they’ve seen on another motivation page. There’s a lot of sayings that I know are good sayings, but I don’t say them because I don’t believe in that. It’s not that they’re not wrong. I just haven’t lived it.</div>
                        </li>
                        <li class="media">
                            <i class="fas fa-square"></i>
                            <div class="media-body"><strong>Fuck everything.</strong> Stop giving a fuck what other people think. How can you give a fuck what people think when they don’t have the full picture? And more importantly, how can you judge someone when you don’t have the full picture?</div>
                        </li>
                        <li class="media">
                            <i class="fas fa-square"></i>
                            <div class="media-body"><strong>When you love what you do, you're consistent as fuck.</strong> Stop judging yourself, so many beating themselves up, did you try as hard as you could? Did you have good intent? Good, you won.</div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-5">These three quotes alone, although variable in relation to mine's, serve as the three fundamental principles of my current stage of life. I love things like these; quotes that aren't necessarily elusive and over-the-top complex; just things that I need to hear and make an effort to contribute to. I may even source some of these principles from personal accounts and interactions with some spectacular people.

                        <h3>Gary "Vee" Vaynerchuk</h3>
                        <p>Gary Vaynerchuk is the chairman of VaynerX, a modern-day media and communications holding company, and the active CEO of VaynerMedia, a full-service advertising agency servicing Fortune 100 clients across the company’s five locations.
                           In the late 90s, after identifying <em>the Internet</em> as a land-grab opportunity, Gary transitioned his father’s local liquor store into one of the first wine e-commerce platforms, resulting in the family business growing from <strong>$3-60M</strong> in sales during a 5-year period.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5"> Oh, I remember this quote. From the novel <em>Persepolis Rising</em> by James S. A. Corey, and part of <em>The Expanse</em> series of books. The quote, in itself, brings forth an inner surge of power; at least for me. Something to not only keep you going should you fall down the hole (again), but to do it without the fear of failure and back-breaking efforts.</p>
                    <h3>3.1. &nbsp; As bespoken by one of the most pivotal characters in the books :</h3>
                    <p class="mb-5">Winston Duarte, High Consul of the Laconian Empire, former 5-star Admiral of the Martian Congressional Republic Navy.</p>
                    <h3>3.2. &nbsp; Function over form. Full stop :</h3>
                    <p class="mb-5">"<em>Winston Duarte's office was plain and comfortable. The desk was simple pressed polycarbonate, a little larger maybe than the receptionist's in the lobby. The screen on the wall was set to a calm semi-abstract piece that flowed in sepia and brown, evoking fallen leaves and mathematical proofs in roughly equal proportions.
                        The only touch of luxury was a shelf of what appeared to be actual printed books on military strategy. The man himself fit in the space like he'd been designed for it.</em>"
                        <br><br>
                        An apt description for a life of productivity and efficiency overrun with complex internal processes and fleeting deadlines. Entering the stage of life that I find myself in currently; adulthood; is defined by such a piece of literature in the face of self-development, mental discipline, and or career development.

                        <p>James S.A. Corey is the pen name of book authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck. They both live in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States of America, as authors of the renowned science fiction series <em>The Expanse</em>. The first and last name are taken from Abraham's and Franck's middle names, respectively, and S. A. are the initials of Abraham's daughter. The name is also meant to emulate many of the space opera writers of the 1970s, such as Isaac Asimov, Frank Herbert, and so on.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Solemn, honest-to-God, and real. Expectations, expectations, expectations; from people. The one fatal mistake of following through with this will simply lead to peer pressure and, at worst, Imposter Syndrome; from me, myself, and I.
