                    <h2 class="mb-3">Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember</h2>
                    <p>
                        Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) is a leading university in the field of science and technology in Indonesia. Established in 1960 in Surabaya, Indonesia, ITS aims to become a world-class university contributing to the independence of the nation and becoming a reference in education, research and community service, as well as the development of innovation, especially those that support the industry and the maritime sector.
                    </p>
                    <p>Accepted in <strong>September 2020</strong> as an international S1 student of <strong><em>Informatics</em></strong> (IUP), this place serves as a personal new start. A freshman only by title, not by experience, this was a grand opportunity for me to rebuild from the ground up via an alternate learning path. The more I explore on the facilities that this institute has to offer, the more paths I see for me to tread upon, and the more exceptional people that I may meet. The show isn't over yet, it seems. Alternatively, I think it's just beginning.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">I will be very honest with you, despite the rapid and continued development of self, knowledge, and experience, I consider myself as an average student. Nothing special nor notable in terms of achievements. In fact, I have <em>zero</em> luck in student organizations; on the contrary, I have seen significant success in professional fields such as open job positions and campaign volunteer candidacy.

                    <p>
                        Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) is an international, public university that has roots dating back to 1931, when it was first established as the Malaysian School of Agriculture. Despite a series of name changes over the years, it has maintained a focus on agriculture while also becoming a prominent research university.
                    </p>
                    <p>Accepted in <strong>October 2018</strong> as an international student in the undergraduate's programme for <strong><em>Biomedical Sciences</em></strong>, this place was a beautiful, albeit flawed, piece of memory. A true freshman, this was a long and arduous journey in the next steps of my life. Still unprepared to lead a life of independence, this phase was defined by countless mistakes, literal plot twists, and constant self-assessments and development.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        As for experience, I managed to study here for circa 2 years, participating in student organizations and extra credit classes unrelated to my field of study. On the contrary, I have achieved many a great things here as well; managing to complete my first specialst certifications trials and given the opportunity to apply for an acceleration course on military medicine.
